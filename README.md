OMERO Process Container Steward
===============================

Tools for stewardship of the OMERO server ProcessContainer.

Requirements
============

* OMERO 5.6.x+
* Java 8+

Installation
============

The latest release artifact can be found from
[Glencoe Artifactory](https://artifacts.glencoesoftware.com/ui/native/omero-plus/com/glencoesoftware/omero/).

It can also be build by hand:

        git clone git@github.com:glencoesoftware/omero-pc-steward.git
        cd omero-pc-steward
        ./gradlew jar

1. Copy the downloaded `.jar` or the built one from `build/libs` into the `$OMERODIR/lib/server` directory of your OMERO installation

2. Configure logging by adding `<logger name="com.glencoesoftware" level="INFO"/>` to the "ROOT logger" section of `$OMERODIR/etc/logback.xml`

3. Optionally, configure the frequency of the cleanup checks by setting the config `omero.managed.steward.cron` to a valid cron string (see https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/api/2.4.x/org/quartz/CronExpression.html). The default is set to check every minute for completed import processes to clean up. If you wanted to check every 30 seconds, you could set

        omero config set omero.managed.steward.cron '*/30 * * * * ?'

5. Restart OMERO server with

        omero admin restart

6. In `$OMERODIR/var/log/Blitz-0.log`, you should see logging from the ProcessContainerSteward once per configured period (default every minute) reporting how many `ImportProcesses` there are in the `ProcessContainer`
